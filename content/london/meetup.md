Fair computational intelligence is important because AI is augmenting human tasks and decisions within every facet of life. As a core component of society, sports and entertainment are becoming driven with machine learning algorithms. For example, over 10 million ESPN fantasy football players use Watson insights to pick their roster week over week. A fair post processor ensures NFL players, irrespective of the team assignment, are projected for an impartial boom in play so that owners avoid basing their team roster decisions on biased insights. This is critically important because users spent over 7.7 billion minutes on the ESPN Fantasy Football platform during the 2018 season. In another example, automated video highlight generation at golf tournaments should be contextually fair. Golf player biographical data, game play context and weather information should not skew deep learning excitement measurements. An overall player video highlight excitement score that includes gesture, crowd noise, commentator tone, spoken words, facial expressions, body movement and 40 situational features is continually debiased. The resulting highlights are pulled into personalized highlight reels and stored on a web accelerator tier. Throughout the talk, I will show examples of using an open source library called IBM AI Fairness 360 and the IBM OpenScale cloud service to provide highly veracious insights.</p> <p>ODSC Links:<br/>• Get free access to more talks like this at LearnAI:<br/><a href="https://learnai.odsc.com/" class="linkified">https://learnai.odsc.com/</a><br/>• Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OPENDATASCI/" class="linkified">https://www.facebook.com/OPENDATASCI/</a><br/>• Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/odsc" class="linkified">https://twitter.com/odsc</a> &amp; @odsc<br/>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-data-science/" class="linkified">https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-data-science/</a><br/>• East Conference Apr 30 - May 3: <a href="https://odsc.com/boston" class="linkified">https://odsc.com/boston</a></p>  

## Art Hackathon - "Artificial Emotional Intelligence" 

<p>Due to popular demand, we're having another hands-on art hackathon!</p> <p>The theme is ... "Artificial Emotional Intelligence".</p> <p>---</p> <p>Art Hackathon</p> <p>An art hackathon (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" class="linkified">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon</a>) means coming together in a shared space, and being collectively inspired, to create algorithmic art at the meetup itself.</p> <p>Hackathons are really fun, hands on practical (there's no talk or lecture), and we're often surprised how much can be created in a limited time.</p> <p>Beginners are very welcome, as well as more experienced friends who can help others.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Artistic Constraints</p> <p>All the best art emerges from constraints, often consciously self-imposed. This hack will have some constraints:</p> <p>• You must create your art at openprocessing.org (<a href="https://www.openprocessing.org" class="linkified">https://www.openprocessing.org</a>), which uses the web version of processing (<a href="http://processing.org" class="linkified">http://processing.org</a>) called p5js (<a href="https://p5js.org" class="linkified">https://p5js.org</a>). We've run several beginner's tutorial previously, with tutorial slides and video on the meetup blog (<a href="http://algorithmicartmeetup.blogspot.co.uk/2017/05/a-gentle-introduction-to-processing.html" class="linkified">http://algorithmicartmeetup.blogspot.co.uk/2017/05/a-gentle-introduction-to-processing.html</a>). You can find a structured beginners course here (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/creative-coding-for-kids" class="linkified">https://sites.google.com/view/creative-coding-for-kids</a>).</p> <p>• You must allow your code and work to be publicly viewable and freely copyable and reusable (CC-SA (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" class="linkified">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/</a>)).</p> <p>• We have 60 minutes to create the art from scratch.</p> <p>• The work must be inspired by the theme "Artificial Emotional Intelligence". You're can interpret this in any way you wish.</p> <p>• Your own constraints (colour, shape, other) - do tell us when you're showing your work.</p> <p>If people want to work together, that's fine. We'll organise working-together groups at the start.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Practical Stuff</p> <p>To make sure things get done, we'll stick to the following schedule:</p> <p>• 6.30 - 7.00pm - organise teams / individuals / mentors / tasks</p> <p>• 7.00 - 8.00pm - start art hack!</p> <p>• 8.00 - 8.30pm - show your work on the big displays</p> <p>Support will be available for beginners to get going, or help fix any coding problems. Volunteers for helping out really welcome!</p> <p>There will be an opportunity to show and talk about your work at the end, if you let me know in good time.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Blog</p> <p>Selected works created in the hackathon will be shown on the Algorithmic Art blog. Please send the links using the comments or the "contact the organiser" link. Our last hackathon was written up here (<a href="http://algorithmicartmeetup.blogspot.co.uk/2017/09/art-hackathon-future-pangs.html" class="linkified">http://algorithmicartmeetup.blogspot.co.uk/2017/09/art-hackathon-future-pangs.html</a>).</p> <p>----</p> <p>Note the earlier start time of 6.30.</p> <p>Please also book your place at SkillsMatter here: [<a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/12102-algorithmic-art-april" class="linkified">https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/12102-algorithmic-art-april</a>]</p>  

## The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Threat or Opportunity? 

<p>Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, recently stated that AI will have a 'more profound' impact than electricity or fire. The Mckinsey Global Institute forecasts that by 2030 up to 375 million people, or 14% of the global workforce, could lose their jobs due to automation and AI. Until now the main beneficiaries of AI has been the technology sector. Most of the major tech firms Google, Amazon, Facebook in the West and Alibaba and Baidu in China would not be as successful without AI for product recommendations, targeted advertising, logistics forecasting, robots for product sorting, facial recognition and machine learning in voice assistants like Alexa and Google Home.</p> <p>The excitement around AI has made it increasingly difficult to separate reality from hype with many senior business people believing AI to be magic wand while others have warned ‘The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race’ (Stephen Hawkin)</p> <p>The event format will be a penal debate and discussion which will examine whether AI poses a threat or opportunity. and will include a keynote address on the current real challenges of implementing AI following by panel event.</p> <p>Speakers to be announced shortly.</p>

## #9. FinTech & Financial Services: How is the concept of a bank changing? 

<p>Banks play a powerful and symbolic role in most verticals of life. They are the foundation of global society. But their role is evolving.</p> <p>Today, there is more wealth in circulation than there has ever been before. FinTechs are challenging established institutions by making it easier for individuals, businesses and governments to take charge of how currency is captured, created and spent.</p> <p>New business models are emerging, while legacy systems are transforming.</p> <p>We will look at how the concept of a bank is changing in 3 parts: Advancement, Disruption and Philosophy.</p> <p>--<br/>The Symposium Agenda:</p> <p>1. Advancement</p> <p>- Over the years, what has a bank represented for people and businesses?</p> <p>- How are legacy systems integrating emerging technology?</p> <p>We will touch on the progress of the following emerging technologies: AI and ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning), RPA (robot procession automation), Cyber Security, RegTech, InsurTech, Cloud Technology, Blockchain and Crypto Currencies</p> <p>2. Disruption</p> <p>- The dawn of the challenger banks: what are FinTechs challenging &amp; what are their challenges?</p> <p>- How will FinTechs compete/cooperate with legacy banks?</p> <p>- What is the government’s role?</p> <p>We will touch on the following industries and sectors: Compliance, Savings and Investment, Accounting, Legal, Forex, Insurance, Property (PropTech), Crowdfunding, P2P Lending, Robo Advisors and Algorithmic Trading</p> <p>3. Philosophy</p> <p>- Why do we have banks and do we actually need them?</p> <p>- Should user data = currency?</p> <p>- Financial inclusion &amp; the unbanked: how much value can they bring &amp; create?</p> <p>We will touch on the following themes and issues: Financial Inclusion, Ethical Investments, Sustainable Investments, Unbanked Population, Privacy, Credit Scoring, Cyber-Theft, Fraud Prevention, Money Laundering<br/>--<br/>What is The Symposium?</p> <p>The Symposium is a private community of diverse thought leaders, specialists and professionals. We sync tech with philosophy, and host intimate roundtables to explore technological advancement and its consequences for the human state.</p> <p>--</p> <p>Why should I attend?</p> <p>Be part of the conversation, and engage with the leaders shaping the future of your industry.

## Ethics, Bias & Algorithmic Fairness in the world of Artificial Intelligence 

<p>Google recently announced the AI advisory council. They published some principles they plan to follow: <a href="https://ai.google/principles/" class="linkified">https://ai.google/principles/</a><br/>As we move towards an AI revolution, conversations around Bias, algorithmic fairness and our social responsibility towards AI, as data scientists, has become essential.<br/>Join us at an upcoming startup ETIQ AI to address the problems and discuss potential solutions with some amazing women working in this field!</p> <p>ETIQ AI</p> <p>Etiq AI is a tech startup, backed by Zinc VC, which is developing a solution to diagnose and minimise bias and discrimination in machine learning models throughout the AI application lifecycle.</p> <p>Skewed data is one of the common causes for biased AI models. As machine learning models increasingly make automated decisions about a wide variety of issues such as policing, insurance and what information people see online, the implications of their recommendations become broader. This tool helps encourage the teams who build these models to think of, find and mitigate the negative biases these models amplify at the earliest possible stage before time and money is wasted on biased training methods</p> <p>The agenda for the meetup will be as follows:</p> <p>Networking from 6.30 and talks follow from 7 pm.</p> <p>Speaker : Catalina Butnaru,</p> <p>Title: TBC</p> <p>Speaker: Ines Marusic, QuantumBlack</p> <p>Title: "Algorithmic Fairness: From Theory to Practice"</p> <p>Description:</p> <p>Ines is a Senior Data Scientist at QuantumBlack , an advanced analytics firm which helps many of the world's largest companies adopt machine learning &amp; leverage big data at scale. She has developed data science products &amp; solutions in a range of different industries including finance, insurance, pharma &amp; elite sport. Ines coordinates the Fairness &amp; Ethics initiative for QuantumBlack's data science practice globally.</p> <p>The topic:</p> <p>The advances in machine learning in the past few years have enabled us to automate decisions and processes across many specific tasks. Machine learning is increasingly being used to make decisions that can severely affect people's lives, for instance, in education, hiring, lending &amp; criminal risk assessment.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the data used to train these models often contains undesirable bias that exists in our society. The bias can be absorbed or even amplified by the models, leading to decisions that are unfair with respect to gender, race or other sensitive attributes. The goal of algorithmic fairness is to design algorithms that make fair predictions devoid of discrimination.</p> <p>Ines will discuss the recent advances coming from the machine learning research community on algorithmic fairness. She will also provide a practitioner's perspective by presenting an overview of QuantumBlack's process of incorporating techniques from algorithmic fairness effectively on client projects.</p> <p>Speaker: Raluca Crisan, ETIQ AI</p> <p>Title: TBC</p> <p>Description:<br/>Raluca has 10 years of experience in data science working for a variety of clients (major UK retailers, banks &amp; telco companies). Raluca’s experience spans managing large teams to hands-on data product development, including a B2C product that has topic modelling at its core.</p> <p>The topic:</p> <p>She'll give a brief talk on algorithmic bias. As companies start using richer data sources, and deeper algorithms, unintentional bias starts lurking in the dark. Previously, analysts and data scientists were better able to spot it and remove it, now it is becoming harder to do so. The talk aims to answer: What are some newer approaches that data scientists can use to keep an eye on the bias problem? How can all of us, beyond data scientists, ensure the products we are designing do not encode bias at their core?</p> <p>meetup image from: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/the-ethics-of-artificial-intelligence" class="linkified">https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/the-ethics-of-artificial-intelligence</a></p>
