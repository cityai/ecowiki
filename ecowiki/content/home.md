<!-- TITLE: AI WIKI -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Navigation -->

<p>City.AI ambassadors are likeminded people all around the world working on setting up a wiki to map the AI ecosystems on a city level. This will include activities, organizations, startups and people playing an active role either designing, developing or applying AI. Ambassadors and local stakeholders will play a key role curating this information, while the entire AI community will be able to contribute to it. This wiki will be open and accessible by everyone, to help AI practitioners to guide them through the local AI ecosystems, provide insights into the development of the AI community globally, and foster cross-boarder collaboration pushing our mission of enabling the diverse and responsible development and application of Artificial Intelligence further.
