# Overview
<div class=overview>

The AI ecosystem in Oslo is rapidly developing and catching up with other Nordic capitals. An increasing number of AI focused startups are emerging while research initiatives are being further strengthened in academia. Although most large corporations are still exploring the value of AI in the pilot phase, some pioneers have started deploying AI solutions at scale. Traditionally prominent industries in Norway such as Oil & Gas, Fishing and Shipping are among those investing heavily into AI. Local AI communities such as Oslo.AI are prospering and gaining traction.
