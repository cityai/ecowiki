# The initiative
<div class=aboutSection >

<p>The <a href="https://aiwiki.co/">AI ECOSYSTEM WIKI</a> aims to aggregate all relevant information of city-based AI ecosystem globally <strong>enabling global collaboration and AI agenda development and execution by the AI community directly</strong>. This initiative is a cornerstone to achieve City.AI's mission increasing diversity in and drawing attention to responsible development and application of Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://city.ai/">CITY.AI</a></strong> ambassadors are like-minded people all around the world working on setting up a global directory to map the AI ecosystems on a city level. This will include activities, organizations, startups and people playing an active role either designing, developing or applying AI. Ambassadors and local stakeholders will play a key role curating this information, while the entire AI community will be able to contribute to it.</p>

<p><strong>The AI Ecosystem Wiki</strong> will be open and accessible by everyone, to help AI practitioners to guide them through the local AI ecosystems, provide insights into the development of the AI community globally, and foster cross-border collaboration pushing our mission of enabling the diverse and responsible development and application of Artificial Intelligence further.</p>
